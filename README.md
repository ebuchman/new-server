New Server
----------

This directory contains scripts for a simple moderately secure server setup.

Add your info to `info.sh` and ensure you are logged in as root.
Now run: 
`source ./all.bash`

Note you should onlu ever run this once per machine. To repeat parts, like reinstalling go or tendermint,
just use their respective scripts.

Then run tendermint with:
`bash mint`
